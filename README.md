## Description

Eternal Nexus is a spine-chilling sci-fi video game set in a dystopian cyberpunk future, where corporations rule a neon-lit megalopolis on Earth, catering to the privileged elite in search of eternal youth. As the protagonist, a skilled specialty forces member, you uncover a dark secret - the existence of an ancient extraterrestrial artifact on the distant planet known as "Xenos Prime." This artifact is said to grant eternal youth and has become the ultimate prize for the affluent, leaving the rest of humanity struggling in inequality.

Determined to expose the corruption and bring equality to your world, you embark on a perilous voyage to Xenos Prime. Your mission: to steal the powerful artifact and reveal the truth. However, you have no idea that this quest will lead you to incomprehensible terrors and a mind-bending journey through an alien realm.
